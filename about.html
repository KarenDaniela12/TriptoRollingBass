        <p>Hola! My name is Karen Daniela Figueroa and I am a student at the University of Central Florida in the advertising and public relations program, double minoring in psychology and digital media.

            I have a passion for creating content and I am motivated by digital marketing and social media. I would consider myself a very adventurous and curious young woman. I am fascinated with exploring new places and trying new food. I love going to new places to see how culture influences human behavior. Understanding why people do things or how inclined people are to do or buy a product has always been one of my interests. 
            
            When I am not up late studying, I am up late creating videos and editing pictures reliving my adventures the way I see it. Designing posters, flyers and pictures with Adobe Creative Cloud is my new hobby. It has opened my mind to a whole new creative side of advertising. 
            
            I have interned for a nonprofit organization called Getaboard. Our mission is to help fight the high school drop out rate & help break the cycle of homelessness by using action sports and art as a vehicle to empower youth. I have designed graphics and taken pictures of the nonprofit's events. My goal is to get more people interested in the projects I work on by creating educational and engaging images.
            
            I live my life by the saying "Cada momento cuento" means every moment counts. I hope you enjoyed my website.
            
            
            -Karen Daniela Figueroa
