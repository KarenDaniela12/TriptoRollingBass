    <h1>On the road</h1>

    <div>
        <p>So your off on the road now. There is a hot summer heat beaming on the car that the A/C just does not seem to work. AJ keeps trying to move the air vents contemplating if it is really making a difference. The only logical thing is to put down the windows and let the car cool as we drove into the dessert. I am driving going 54 on a highway where the speed limit is 45 mph. While it did not mean much to me or Devin, AJ was a little nervous. He was grabbing the handle on the upper side of the passenger window like he did not trust my driving. The road was not as packed as I expected it to be, therefore it was easy to move through traffic.</p>
        <p>
                “Put some music on!” yells Devin from behind the driver’s seat.
                “What do you want to listen to?” I asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            Devin feels like head banging to some Excision, but AJ wanted something relaxing and smooth like Kygo
