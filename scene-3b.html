    <h1>Excision</h1>

            AJ put Excision’s new album on. I knew he wanted to hear something more like Kygo but he didnt mind. 
            On the other hand, Devin loved the bass in Excision so I knew she approved my choosing. She was extremely excited to see them on stage tonight for their closing act.
            Devin was drinking a Red Bull, I asked her for some. Hanging out with her got me into a Red Bull
            addiction since we are always up.
        </p>
        <p>Devin in the back asked how we were feeling about tonight? AJ was pumped, him and Devin would always sneak into festivals like this so Im sure they got a boost of adrenaline just from thinking about it. Me on the othe hand, this was my first time doing anything like this.</p>
