    <h1>Kygo</h1>
    
    <div>
        <p>AJ really liked Kygo, and I was also in the mood to just relax and enjoy the drive as we were not much farther away from reaching the festival. Devin was drinking a Red Bull, I asked her for some. Hanging out with her got me into a Red Bull addiction since we are always up.</p>
    
        <p>Devin in the back asked how we were feeling about tonight? AJ was pumped, him and Devin would always sneak into festivals like this so Im sure they got a boost of adrenaline just from thinking about it. Me on the othe hand, this was my first time doing anything like this.</p>
