        <p>You just got off the phone with your best friend's AJ, and Devin, and they all convinced you to finally have some long needed fun. Plus your the only one in the group with a van and it was in dire use for this adventure. You are going to Rolling Bass Music Festival on the out skirts of Las Vegas. The most extreme, most intense music festival of the year! Only problem none of you guys had tickets so the only way you were getting in is to sneak. Are you up for it?</p>
